      <h2>Partnering with the PIF Program</h2>
      <p><strong style="color: #0b4778;">Talent and selection:</strong> PIF runs a robust external recruitment program. PIF requires applicants to pass skills & behavioral interviews before requesting agencies interview and select a fellow.</p>
      <p><strong style="color: #0b4778;">Interagency Agreements (IAA):</strong> GSA hires fellows as full-time federal employees at the GS-15, Step 1 level in their first year, and assigns them to agencies. The PIF program provides services to the requesting agency through an IAA. Our standard agreements are non-severable, reimbursable, services agreements.</p>

      <p> <strong style="color: #0b4778;">Duration:</strong> The PIF fellowship term lasts one year, with an option to be considered for a one year term extension.</p>
      <p> <strong style="color: #0b4778;">Timeline of major milestones:</strong>  Between project selection and project start date, agency partners will participate in key activities such as filling out a Request for Information (RFI) and obtaining internal reviews for General Terms & Conditions (GT&C) paperwork.</p>
      <p>Targeted start date for the next cohort of PIF projects is June 2025.</p>
