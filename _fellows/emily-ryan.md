In my 23 years of experience, I have been fortunate enough to work cross-functionally to solve a variety of digital issues, largely within the education and health care sectors, for commercial, federal and state government agencies. I began my career as a web and print designer, then transitioned into a full-stack web and database developer and finally, in the last 10 years, have moved into the User Experience (UX) competency. My unique background means that I am adept at creating solutions that are aesthetically pleasing and are technically feasible. I understand the unique constraints that face designers and developers since I spent many years in both roles prior to moving into UX.
