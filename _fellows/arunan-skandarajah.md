Arunan is an engineer, strategist, and global health practitioner who is passionate about erasing the barriers that people face when trying to access healthcare. He believes that digital tools, when designed with the both the user and the system in mind, can help deliver care more quickly and equitably. He has spent his career developing software and hardware products, generating evidence that they can improve care, and advancing the healthcare ecosystem abroad.

Most recently at the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Arunan developed and led programs to connect diagnostics to public health systems, manufacture COVID tests in new ways, and use inexpensive sensors to measure the risk of disease. As a Program Officer, he structured technology and scale-up strategies, managed cross-functional technical and business/legal teams to invest in innovators, and coordinated collaborations between leading tech and deployment partners. Previously, he developed expertise across the healthcare continuum from providers and insurers to diagnostics and therapeutics companies as a management consultant.

Arunan graduated from Vanderbilt University. He then completed a PhD in Bioengineering at UC Berkeley, where he developed microscopes that paired with mobile phones for diagnosing oral cancer and bloodborne parasites. Outside of work, he has coached small businesses and developed teacher resources for STEM education.
