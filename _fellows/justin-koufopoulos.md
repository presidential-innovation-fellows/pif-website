Justin's work as a Presidential Innovation Fellow across two administrations has been to develop an awareness of the problems faced by the American people, primarily within healthcare and clinical trials access, but also across Internet infrastructure, artificial intelligence, workforce development, and internal IT modernization. Working collaboratively with government leaders and their direct reports, he has worked in uniting diverse perspectives across multiple business lines towards intuitive solutions to complex problems.

Before becoming a Presidential Innovation Fellow, Justin began his career as an organizational design consultant for the Federal government. He then spent a year conducting research on social networks and health behavior at the University of Leeds while on a Fulbright Scholarship. After his master's work he entered the New York City startup scene, where he advised incubator-stage startups before joining the Growth team at Percolate where he led successful content, email, analytics, and product initiatives that helped drive two rounds of venture funding and rapid sales growth. Justin enjoys meditation, yoga, surfing, reading, and having deep conversations over any topic from finance to music. He mentors entrepreneurs of all ages at the Halcyon Incubator, for his alma mater Connecticut College, and the BUILD DC program. He is term member of the Presidential Innovation Fellows Foundation Board.
