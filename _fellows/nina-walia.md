Nina Walia directs experiences and teams for emerging interaction spaces and platforms – often beyond the screen. Her over 15 years experience includes overseeing innovative, award-winning designs intended to motivate, inspire, educate, and improve people’s lives for Nike (Nike+ FuelBand), Google, GE, PBS, and the Office of the First Lady, Michelle Obama's, Let's Move Active Schools initiative. Most recently, Nina was weaving technological experiences into interactive textiles and surfaces as Design Lead for Jacquard, a collaboration between Google and Levi's, which was inducted into the Cooper Hewitt Smithsonian Design Museum's permanent collection. She holds four design patents for her work and has spoken about her craft at many renowned conferences, such as the Interaction Design Association's (IXDA) annual conference, South By SouthWest, Games for Change, the International Conference for Interaction Design and Children, the Asia-Pacific Broadcasting Union's annual workshop, and the National Black Programming Consortium's New Media Institute. She is passionate about community organizing, and co-founded Subcontinental Drift, a nationally syndicated group to encourage South Asian Americans in the arts. She sometimes reminisces about her days as a musician, record label owner, and DJ. Her latest quest is to return to not just facilitating art, but creating more of it herself.
