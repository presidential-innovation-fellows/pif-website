Amy J. Wilsonis a user-centered product manager working at the intersection of communications and technology to solve complex challenges. Her career’s trademark is deconstructing problems and spurring inventive thinking into collaborative action. Tackling problems with a left- (usability/analytic) and right- (design/creative) brain mentality, she has 14 years’ experience shipping products with multiple government agencies, private companies, and nonprofit clients.

After Hurricane Katrina she led a recovery project to build 50 homes in four months as a Team Leader in AmeriCorps*NCCC, partnering with entrepreneurs and nonprofit organizations to solve the problem of landfill overflow and lack of housing opportunities. As the communications manager for the Woodrow Wilson Bridge Project, she successfully partnered with citizens, State and local governments on the largest infrastructure megaproject in one of the most congested areas of the US. On the cusp of Booz Allen Hamilton's 100th Anniversary, she pioneered the company’s Innovation Playbook and Ecosystem, which defined innovation in the context of consulting, made innovation accessible to all, and created virtual and in-person places to incubate ideas. She has challenged the status quo at more than a dozen organizations and can both set and implement the vision. She is excited to serve as a Presidential Innovation Fellow, as it allows her to continue the oath she took in AmeriCorps to 'get things done for America.'
