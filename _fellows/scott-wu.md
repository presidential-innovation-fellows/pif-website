Scott has devoted the past two decades to innovation – working with, launching, and investing in young companies and organizations to disrupt their respective sectors.  Most recently, he was a member of the founding team of Upstart, which is pioneering crowdfunding for recent graduates.  Previously, he co-founded several venture capital and investment firms – including FTV Capital and Blue Horizon Equity – that together manage over $1 billion.  Scott has always remained involved with issues addressing education and global poverty.  He worked on development projects in Tanzania and with a center combatting child prostitution in Bangkok.  He has monitored refugee camps and volunteered in AIDS orphanages.  He was formerly President of Aim High, which focused on education for the underprivileged, and is currently Chairman of the US Committee for Refugees and Immigrants in DC.  He graduated from Dartmouth College and Harvard Business School, and enjoys life in San Francisco with his wife.
