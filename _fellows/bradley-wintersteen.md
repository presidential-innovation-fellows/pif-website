Brad has spent his career working to understand people's needs and creating technology solutions to achieve them. Having worked and conducted research in six countries, he is an experienced and dynamic technologist specializing in bringing together diverse stakeholders and finding ways to make technology achievable for all. 

He most recently served as the Director of IT Strategy for the City of Detroit, where he oversaw a wide range of large scale technology implementations. His time with the City of Detroit is most remembered for his time on the Covid19 Executive Team where he developed and managed a system to procure and distribute over 7.2 million items of PPE.

Brad has also worked for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees to develop statistical formulas and guidelines for targeted aid distributions and as a AIF William J. Clinton Fellow in Bangalore, India. 
 
When not in the office, he is kept busy chasing after his toddler and dog or moonlighting as a woodworker and car mechanic.

Brad earned his Masters of Public Policy from the University of Michigan as well as a Bachelors in Global Studies from Global College of Long Island University.
