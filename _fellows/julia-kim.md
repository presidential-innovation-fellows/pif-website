 Julia is focused on technology and media that help people address hard problems. She has tackled everything from improving the decision-making of troops on the ground to forecasting future science & technology trends. For the past eight years, she directed projects at the University of Southern California Institute for Creative Technologies (ICT), an Army-funded research center developing immersive technologies to benefit education, health care, and peopleâ€™s lives. Leading teams that included researchers, developers, Hollywood talent, and military personnel, Julia produced educational games, short films, virtual reality-based installations and artificial intelligence systems that were used across the Department of Defense. Before ICT, Julia was a management consultant and programmer guiding and executing technology development for companies. Julia has a BA and MA in history of science from Harvard University where she studied how people use technology. Originally from the DC area, Julia now lives in Los Angeles, CA.
