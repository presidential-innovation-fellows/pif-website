Scott feels passionately about creating disproportionate positive impact and equity in society.  The last 10 years of his work reflects that philosophy.  He most recently co-led a social innovation and design consulting agency based in New York called Community by Design, that delivered human-centric concepts at the intersection of design thinking, civic innovation practices, and community organizing.  Some of these projects included co-creating an interfaith institute at Harvard University focused on improving the public education system, devising a strategic plan with the City of New York that bridged the technology industry with underserved communities, and developing strategic programming within the United Nations on sustainable tourism practices.

Prior to that, Scott worked at the award-winning design agency IDEO as an organizational and experience designer.  This work focused on helping organizations of all shapes, sizes and industries transform themselves into more human-centered, and design-led organizations. In addition, Scott collaborated with senior IDEO leadership on cross-industry, systems-level work that re-imagined aging, dying, and modern religion in American society.

In his spare time, Scott guest lectures at NYU and Parsons on topics such as: Design Thinking for Social Impact, Design Research, and Storytelling.
