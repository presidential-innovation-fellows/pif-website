For the four years prior to PIF, Andrea (she/her) worked at Alation, makers of software used for data-driven decision making. Most recently she held the role of Technical Lead on the Data Science and Analytics team, where she worked to enable teams throughout the organization to use data to make better decisions. She not only calculated metrics, built models, performed analyses, and helped others do the same, but also developed a data onboarding curriculum to teach data skills and awareness to Alation’s new employees. Andrea enjoys teaching others the skills of data and analytics and how it can be used to make better decisions. She has also taught night classes on the skills and techniques of data and analytics to continuing education students.

Throughout her career, Andrea has worked at various startups and established companies in a number of data roles, including data analytics, data engineering, and data science. PIF is not Andrea’s first experience working with a government agency; she previously worked for a government contractor studying the effects of Medicare policy changes with the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS). 

Andrea graduated from Harvey Mudd College, where she studied mathematics and the impact it can have on the world. She currently resides in Burlingame, California.
