From organizing Google’s first disability-focused hackathon, to expanding grant access for young artists across the Front Range, to amplifying the impact of 300+ grassroots nonprofits, Eboni J.D. Freeman is dedicated to the underestimated. 

Eboni’s story began at age fourteen when she was diagnosed with Lupus: the disease that killed two of her aunts before she was born. First, she wondered, “why me?” Then, she knew, “why not me,” and began volunteering, speaking up, and building out her capacity for transforming life’s trials into community triumphs. To achieve this goal, she studied Strategy and Management Consulting at Emory University’s Goizueta Business School, as well as Product Management at the University of California, Berkeley. Along the way, she founded two startups at the intersection of systems engineering and human-centered design.

Now, she is excited to expand her skill sets to address critical challenges facing our country and effectively deliver services to improve lives across our nation. In a galaxy of ideas and opportunities, Eboni finds delight in connecting these stars into a constellation of hope.
