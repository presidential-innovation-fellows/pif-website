Ross Dakin is a software engineer who enjoys bringing new products to life within dynamic, young companies. Most recently, Ross helped the crowdsourced same day delivery provider Deliv achieve market-winning growth by rebuilding the company's technical infrastructure that is now trusted by such enterprises as Macy's and T-Mobile. Prior to Deliv, Ross helped create novel financial services at Upstart, cyber threat intelligence collaboration at BrightPoint Security, and distributed callcenter technology at LiveOps, where he also coordinated employee philanthropic efforts as a member of the LiveOps Foundation.

As a licensed EMT, Ross volunteers his time providing prehospital emergency care services under the auspices of various organizations including the National Ski Patrol, Palo Alto Medical Reserve Corps, Santa Clara County Medical Volunteers for Disaster Response, and multiple arms of the American Red Cross.

Ross holds a Bachelors of Science in Computer Engineering degree from Santa Clara University, where he currently serves on the Dean's Engineering Advisory Board. Ross resides in the San Francisco Bay Area when he's not in Washington, D.C., though he remains loyal to the sports teams of his beloved hometown: San Diego.
