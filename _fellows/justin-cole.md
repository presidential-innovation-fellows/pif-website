Justin Cole has dedicated his career to playing the role of translator - whether helping translate between clinicians and data scientists in the design of an AI support tool at IBM, or between seasoned street sweeper operators and civic technologists to design a better application with Pittsburgh’s Department of Public Works. He loves making real human connections by “getting out of the building” and meeting and empathizing with users, anticipating where there may be gaps in understanding, and proactively addressing them to facilitate meaningful conversations. He enjoys building high-performing teams, elevating the work of others, and helping to make connections to draw new insights.

As a PIF, Justin helped found the Office of Innovation (FDITECH) at the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), helping the Corporation strategically and thoughtfully consider how to incorporate technology into its existing operations through the use of rapid phased prototyping and technology sprints.

After the signing of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, Justin began supporting the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy's Subcommittee on Equitable Data and helps to ensure that the $1.2 trillion investment in our nation's infrastructure is done in an equitable way.

Before PIF, Justin served as a Managing Consultant at IBM and worked in the areas of economic development and disaster recovery, helping local, state, and Federal government agencies recover from Hurricane Sandy and be more resilient to future disasters.

Justin has a Master of Science in Public Policy & Management (Data Analytics) from Carnegie Mellon University and a BA in Economics and Policy Studies from Syracuse University. He is a certified Project Management Professional (PMP) and is a Board member of Community Tax Aid, a nonprofit that provides free tax preparation for low-income individuals. -->
