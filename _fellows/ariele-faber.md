Ariele Faber is passionate about improving overall quality of life for those who are most vulnerable in the U.S. and globally. Ariele began her career in direct care settings serving older adults and children with complex neurological and developmental health experiences. These early encounters sparked a desire to better understand and meet the needs of populations affected by system-level healthcare challenges.

Prior to government, Ariele worked in design strategy at Johnson & Johnson, leading care-centered design initiatives across the enterprise. Before J&J, she served as the patient experience designer for NYU Langone Health System and was a fellow in the Center for Healthcare Innovation and Delivery Science (CHIDS). Earlier on, Ariele was the founder and owner of Cerebella Design, a science-inspired textiles business.
