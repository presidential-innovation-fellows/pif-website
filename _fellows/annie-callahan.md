Annie Callahan uses data to change organizations and minds. She believes data is a starting point to build relationships and find common ground. Throughout her career, Annie's favorite projects required reimagining what was possible. She's excited to now do this at the Office of Management and Budget.

Annie began her career in Silicon Valley. There, she helped grow a data analytics startup from 30 people to 200. Her work focused on how the technology of the future would affect clients like NASA, Intel, and Pfizer. She then moved to New York to work in finance operations at Bridgewater Associates. Annie relocated to Chicago in 2020, where she realized her love of public service by supporting veteran communities at the University of Chicago and Cook County Court. 

Annie earned her undergraduate degree in biology from Cornell University. She recently received her master's degree in public policy from the University of Chicago.

Annie Callahan is a proud upstate New York native. She currently lives in the DC area with her husband, Rob, and her toughest customer, Moose the corgi.
