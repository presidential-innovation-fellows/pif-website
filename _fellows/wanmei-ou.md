As a proud mother of two daughters, Wanmei Ou is committed to leveraging digital technology to achieve a sustainable healthcare system. Wanmei’s experience spans the full healthcare continuum from providers, payers and life science companies.

Since graduating from Massachusetts Institution of Technology with a PhD in Computer Science, Wanmei has led multiple enterprise digital initiatives transforming the use of data to enable precision medicine, adjudicate value-based reimbursement and accelerate biomedical research. In her most recent position as Director of Outcomes Research and Data Science at Merck & Co., Inc., she focused on the generation of real-world evidence through both observational studies and innovation pilots. Working with cross-functional teams, she delivered a digital solution to streamline the execution of observational studies and insight dissemination across the company’s product lines.

Prior to Merck, Wanmei was a product strategist at Oracle Healthcare Life Sciences Global Business Unit, where she oversaw an end-to-end software product development cycle from business plans to product launch and implementation. During this time she also served on the Health Information Technology Standards Committee supporting the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology.
