Yll Agimi (he/him) is a Data Scientist covering the domains of machine learning, statistics and healthcare. Most recently, Yll worked at General Dynamics Information Technology as a Senior Data Scientist, leading a team building advanced data solutions for clients, including the Military Health System (MHS), the health system supporting some 10 million active-duty personnel, military retirees and their families. Yll partnered with senior stakeholders to scope, develop and deliver new innovative approaches to incorporating data science into aspects of healthcare operations and clinical decision making. He oversaw the development and use of algorithms and statistical predictive models to evaluate health outcomes. He led teams in determining analytical approaches and modeling techniques. Supported clients in extracting insights out of structured and unstructured data to solve complex business problems by relying on statistical techniques and broad knowledge of healthcare systems. 

In 2019, parallel to his work, Yll designed a digital solution to monitor and display real-time messages to audiences based on demographic characteristics, setting such as time of day, using machine learning platforms (TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV). He placed first at the the Universidad Adolfo Ibanez, Chile Prototypes Challenge and a finalist at the Virginia Tech 2019 Global Entrepreneur Challenge.   

While at Booz Allen Hamilton, Yll et al. built the “Chronic Disease and Healthcare Cost Predictor” a personal disability predictor tool: a tool to model the probability of disease using user data and data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. Another of Yll’s creations was the “Heath 2 Head Voting Comparator,"" a web tool developed as part of National Library Contest that allows users to compare the voting records of any two Senators or Congress members, tracking the bills or topics on which may agree. Prior to that, Yll’s little app called QuickQuestion, an app that helps you answer life’s questions, both big and small, lived on the app stores, yet never taking off. 

Yll holds a Bachelor’s degree from the University of Prishtina, Kosovo, and a Masters in Public Health, a Masters in Epidemiology and a Ph.D. in Public Health, all from the University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA.
