Previously, Adam was an entrepreneur-in-residence at the Mayo Clinic, where he was involved in the strategic planning of new healthcare products and services.  His responsibilities included developing new ventures at the intersection of healthcare and technology to expand Mayo Clinic's scope and reach through new business models.  While at Mayo Clinic, Adam incubated a digital health startup, Better, funded by Mayo Clinic and The Social+Capital Partnership.  Adam also managed Mayo Clinic's relationship and investment strategy with startup accelerator Rock Health.  Adam has held previous positions at NASAâ€™s human factors research division and two strategy and innovation consultancy firms, Jump Associates and Method Inc.  Adam's non-traditional path to Mayo Clinic was driven by his passion for redefining the healthcare value proposition from its current focus on sick-care to a model focused on consumer value, engagement, and disease prevention.  He received a BS in Communications from Syracuse University and an MBA in Design Strategy from the California College of the Arts.  He currently lives in California with his wife Kyoko and enjoys surfing, biking, running marathons, and competitive skydiving.
