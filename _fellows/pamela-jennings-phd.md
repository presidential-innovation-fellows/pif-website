Pamela served as a professor, academic administrator, and research director at a range of higher education institutions from Research 1 Universities to Art and Design colleges and HBCUs. As an academic, she taught, mentored, and supported innovative projects and their people who worked across and in-between academic disciplines and professional practices.

She has been a contributor and project lead in several National Academies of Sciences (NAS) initiatives that elevated the importance of integrative learning and research in higher education. This included being a consensus committee member for the 2018 NAS report, “Integration of the Humanities and Arts with Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine in Higher Education: Branches from the Same Tree”.

In her leisure, Pamela enjoys singing Puccini and Copeland.
