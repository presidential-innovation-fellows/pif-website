As a college undergrad, Vidya co-founded a govtech startup (DMV.org) and turned it into a multi-million-dollar business before turning 21.  With a lean team of 5 individuals, she built a web platform that continues to help over 110 million Americans annually.  She and her team took their mission to the next level to build a large portfolio of high-growth, high-impact govtech businesses and launched a successful online publishing company that made the Inc. 5000 list, reporting 391% growth in three years.  Most recently, she founded Neppalli Strategy to push this philosophy and mission to a greater magnitude: create a support system for a group of organizations, each managing a portfolio of high-potential startups, and bring them to scale.  These organizations include accelerators like Nike + Tech Stars Accelerator, Wieden + Kennedy's Portland Incubator Experiment, VC funds, and angel portfolios.  Vidya holds an engineering degree in Computer Science and an MBA from UCSD.  In between gigs, Vidya travels around the world in search of a sweet swell while creating art, short films, and poetry.
