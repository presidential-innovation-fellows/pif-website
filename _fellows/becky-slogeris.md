Becky Slogeris is a social impact designer and design justice advocate. Most recently she was Associate Director at the Center for Social Design at Maryland Institute College of Art (MICA), where she brought MICA students together with outside partners to advance equity and social justice through design. 

Her previous work touched on many of the most pressing challenges in Baltimore – from public health to public policy to public education – and engaged some of the city’s most underserved residents in developing their own responses to systems that have been deliberately crafted to exclude them. Other past experience includes stints at The Center for Urban Pedagogy, Baltimore Urban Debate League, and Wide Angle Youth Media. She’s passionate about blending technical expertise and lived experience to create processes and products that work for all stakeholders. She is a graduate of MICA with a BFA in graphic design and an MA in Social Design. -->
