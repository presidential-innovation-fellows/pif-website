Sweta brings 10 years of experience in using human-centered design, business & marketing strategy, and facilitation to help public sector, non-profit, and advocacy organizations solve complex customer experience problems.

Prior to becoming a PIF, Sweta was a Civic Design Researcher with The Lab @ DC, a policy and program design & evaluation office in District Government. In this role, Sweta supported agencies in making government services more accessible and user-friendly for DC residents using human-centered design methods. Sweta worked on programs and services relating to housing, food & financial benefits, gun violence reduction, public transit, and early childhood education. With a lens of design justice, Sweta supported agencies in practically engaging and working with residents & front-line staff to identify improvement areas for service delivery.
