Renata (she/her) began her career in web and print design, then transitioned to User Experience Design after earning an MFA from Parsons School of Design. Before becoming a PIF, she had the opportunity to work across industry, for companies such as Apple, CBS Interactive, Bank of America, and Electronic Arts. She has worked to improve organizational processes and services, design applications, solve user needs, provide research, and build design teams and operations. Renata has also assisted nonprofits to accomplish their business goals, including winning an award for the best Social Justice App assisting the International Justice Mission to rescue more people out of human trafficking. She has consulted with CEOs looking to build startups to tackle some of today’s wicked problems including climate change, food insecurity, and reskilling the workforce. She has also been an NYC Innovation Fellow working to overhaul and digitize city operations impacting the lives of millions of New Yorkers.

As a PIF in her first year, she worked closely with leaders at Veterans Affairs (VA) Veterans Experience Office (VEO) and the Office of the Chief Technology Officer (OCTO) to develop new systems and processes to align all user research within the VA under one roof, reducing rework and saving the agency money. She also created and grew the first Design Operations Community of Practice for all designers within government. She has grown the community from 10 people to 200 representing over 20 federal agencies, five states, and two city level government agencies. 

In her second year, she continued to develop the community of practice and worked closely with the innovation portfolio at Technology Transformation Services (TTS) focusing on product strategy and adoption for the U.S. Web Design System. Her work led to the team growing from 1 to 3 full time staff, as well as getting funding to move to a componentized design system. 

In her third year, she ran a 90 day pilot to identify the thorniest issues in developing, socializing, and codifying web standards in the federal government. She launched the Federal Website Standards program, website, and initial standards before onboarding a full time hire to continue to grow and expand on the work. This work will lead to better and more consistent digital products across the government.

Her unique background makes her adept at creating solutions to complex problems all while saving money and solving user’s needs, even within limited budgets.
