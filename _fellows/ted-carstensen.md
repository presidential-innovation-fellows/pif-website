Ted moved to Washington DC in early 2020 (pre-pandemic) after almost two years at a venture backed startup in Silicon Valley where he had roles in business development, product management, and marketing. Before exploring the startup world, Ted spent nine years in Fortune 500 companies, including six years as a product manager and buyer at Amazon and three years at GE where he participated in a rotational leadership development program. Prior to business school, Ted spent three years working for a negotiation consulting firm, which is an area of interest he developed as an undergraduate. Ted received his MBA from MIT Sloan School of Management and his MA and BA from Stanford University.
