Georgeta Dragoiu is an entrepreneur, business strategist, and public relations professional. As the founder of a strategic communications firm in Washington, D.C., Georgeta has served as a key strategist in shaping the public debate on issues such as driverless cars, climate change, gender equality, and technology policy.
