Kaeli is an MD and clinical informaticist experienced in research, product management, and health information technologies. She is very excited about leading data- and compassion-drive transformation of healthcare and medicine. Her drive to make an impact in this area was sparked by early career experiences at VA Palo Alto developing clinical decision support applications for the electronic health record, and she is thrilled to be joining VA once more as a Presidential Innovation Fellow. She enjoys building products, processes, and teams from the ground up, and has recently done so at The Human Diagnosis Project, Akido Labs, and the D-Health Lab at the University of Southern California.  Originally from Los Angeles, California, Kaeli received an MD from the Keck School of Medicine of the University of Southern California, and a BS in biology from Stanford University.
