Ryan is a computational scientist with wet lab training in the life sciences. His technical expertise includes enterprise architecture, healthcare and life sciences data management, software engineering and high performance computing.

As a PIF with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Data Modernization Initiative (DMI), Ryan architected the agency’s [data exchange modernization](https://www.cdc.gov/surveillance/data-modernization/technologies/cdc-front-door.html){:target="_blank"}. He supplied the technical leadership to get CDC’s Enterprise Data Exchange (DEX) system approved, staffed and piloted: FHIR for healthcare surveys, HL7v2 for case notifications and electronic lab reporting, and flat files for routine immunizations. He also contributed to the nation’s public health [North Star Architecture](https://www.cdc.gov/surveillance/data-modernization/technologies/north-star-architecture.html){:target="_blank"} and served as the agency’s technical subject matter expert on the Trusted Exchange Framework and Common Agreement (TEFCA).

Prior to PIF, Ryan was the Chief Software Architect at Amida Technology Solutions, leading data modernization and interoperability engagements with large healthcare enterprises. Ryan was an early employee at several life-sciences start-ups, including BioBright, Oxford Nanopore Technologies, and Ginkgo Bioworks.

He holds a DPhil (PhD) in Computational Biophysics from the University of Oxford (NSF Graduate Research Fellow, NIH-Oxford Scholar), where he studied DNA bending with supercomputers and DNA helicases with single-molecule microscopes. He received a Bachelor of Science in Biomedical Engineering, with a minor in Economics, from Johns Hopkins University. Ryan is a proud product of Baltimore City Public Schools.
