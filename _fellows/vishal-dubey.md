He has led strategic and innovation initiatives for Fortune 100 Health and Tech companies (Kaiser, Walgreens, HP, Meta, Accenture and more) as well as for venture backed startups on ground up product development and market adoption.

Early on in his career, eager to transform Healthcare, Vishal co-founded Heal Deal, one of the first digital health startups to help uninsured patients with affordability and direct provider access. Driven by his passion for Healthcare, Vishal then joined Kaiser Permanente to envision and architect its digital strategy, including Kaiser's Patient platform, one of the first digital front door for prevention, engagement and virtual care. Later he worked on incubation of data and AI driven products at innovation labs of tech companies, including HP and Meta. Most recently he worked with Walgreens on initiatives ranging from creation of Walgreens Health to digital transformation of its nationwide stores. 

Over the last 15 years, Vishal has also been working with silicon valley startups as fractional CxO or Board advisor on Product Development, Adoption and Commercialization. To help and encourage entrepreneurship, Vishal also volunteers his time advising portfolio companies of startup accelerators working with Astia (Women entrepreneurs), Stanford StartX and CLSI.
