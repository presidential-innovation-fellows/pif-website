He has led strategic and innovation initiatives for Fortune 100 Health and Tech companies (Kaiser, Walgreens, HP, Meta, Accenture and more) as well as for venture backed startups on ground up product development and market adoption.

Later he worked on incubation of data and AI driven products at innovation labs of tech companies, including HP and Meta. Most recently he worked with Walgreens on initiatives ranging from creation of Walgreens Health to digital transformation of its nationwide stores. 

Over the last 15 years, Vishal has also been working with silicon valley startups as fractional CxO or Board advisor on Product Development, Adoption and Commercialization.
