Diana is a data, machine learning, and natural language scientist who is passionate about building data products for public good.

Before becoming a PIF, she was a machine learning scientist at Capital One, where she led the development of innovative behavioral, anomaly detection, and natural language understanding algorithms to fight fraud and improve customer experience. 

Prior to Capital One, she was an economic development and technology innovation strategist at HR&A Advisors, where she helped public and private sector clients--including The Trust for Public Land, Knight Foundation, NYC Office of the Mayor, and NYC Economic Development Corporation--develop strategic plans to improve the livability of cities. As part of her work, she led the 2015 launch of NYC BigApps, New York City's flagship civic technology competition where citizens come together to build solutions for the city's toughest challenges. 

Diana graduated magna cum laude from Princeton University and lives in Brooklyn, NY.
