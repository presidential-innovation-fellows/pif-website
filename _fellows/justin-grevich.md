Previously, Justin was a Web Developer and Systems Administrator at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD), Institute of Engineering in Medicine.  His interest in information systems started with extended bulletin board systems where he gained sponsorship from US Robotics (now 3Com) while in middle school.  He studied biomedical science and specialized in the genetic engineering of plants for industrial and medicinal use at the University of Central Florida.  He was drawn back to computer science after extensive genomic analysis of chloroplasts utilizing modern scripting languages, open-source software, and supercomputers.  The joy of programming led him to a deep interest in web development and information security.  At UCSD, he led a team that developed and open-sourced REUManager, an online application system that streamlines the application process for the NSF Research Experience for Undergraduates program.  He is a vocal proponent of open-source software and actively creates new projects as well as contributing to existing ones. Originally from Minnesota, he now lives in San Diego, CA, with his wife Sri.
