Ha-Hoa Hamano (she/her) is a mission-driven technologist with over 13 years of experience that includes product leadership roles with leading media companies and rising startups.  Most recently, she was the Principal Product Manager of the NPR One Experience at NPR. In her role, Ha-Hoa led cross-functional teams to build a portfolio of tools and interactions that support a ubiquitous, personalized experience to meet NPR listeners wherever they are. She launched NPR on digital experiences via large screens, wearables, connected cars, voice assistants, and other emerging devices. 

Throughout her career, from serving as an AmeriCorps team leader, then at a non-profit supporting Vietnamese immigrants, to fundraising and building campaign software, Ha-Hoa has aimed to thread the needle between driving technical innovation and being an agent for social change.

She enjoys biking very slowly around DC's many trails, learning to bond with her very analog range oven, and trying anything at least once.
