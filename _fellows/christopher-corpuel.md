Christopher is an innovation and growth leader who combines strategy, CX design, product and brand management skills with an ability to align global resources and capabilities to bring compelling single and multi-channel products, services, and experiences to fruition.

Working with some of the world’s best known brands, from the Fortune 500 to early stage startups, Christopher was most recently Global Head of Product at CBRE where he oversaw the development and launch of Hana, their global flexible space offering, delivering engaging and productive work environments for owners and occupiers at scale. Previous to CBRE, at Amazon, he spearheaded business development and partner marketing in their global Appstore focused on accelerating the strategic acquisition and retention of content across first and third-party devices covering all non-game industry verticals. Before Amazon, Christopher was at Hilton where he led multiple product and brand efforts coordinating cross-functional teams in the creation and delivery of several industry leading, award-winning programs including LightStay and Digital Key across their global portfolio of 17 brands, 100+ countries, and 5900 hotels.

A highly focused team leader known for clearly communicating goals, fueling fresh ideas, and breathing life into new and existing functions, Christopher believes any transformative effort starts and ends with a collection of diverse talent, sharing a common purpose, who are committed to delivering meaningful results.
