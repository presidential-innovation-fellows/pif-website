bio_full: "Emily is a social impact designer and design researcher who began her career as a visual designer and writer. She is dedicated to helping effect systemic change so that all humans have equitable opportunities to be healthy and happy. Curious about the intersection of public health and education, Emily studied the disparities in both while completing an M.A. in Social Design from the Maryland Institute College of Art (MICA). Her thesis work focused on youth-experienced trauma in Baltimore and the impact of chronic stress on education.

Emily recently worked with Baltimore’s Behavioral Health Leadership Institute to write and design a community health worker toolkit, and helped develop a transdisciplinary process guide for innovative problem solving as a design researcher at the Johns Hopkins Armstrong Institute for Patient Safety & Quality. She is an experienced workshop facilitator and holds a B.F.A. in Graphic Design from the Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT) where she later taught public & social service design. An avid music lover, Emily spent three years volunteering as Girls Rock! Rochester’s Creative Director and served on their board of directors. She currently rests her head in Baltimore, but Rochester is home. Emily spends her free time cooking, practicing yoga, reading about the social sciences, gardening, and going to shows."
