name: OSHA Heat Safety Tool App
agency: DOL
description: "Rebuilding the OSHA Heat Safety Tool app, a successful app with strong adoption which had nonetheless been abandoned for 4 years. In addition to modernizing the design, the point of the project is to model within the Department of Labor how quickly and cheaply the agile model can deliver and maintain a digital service, and to build an example of a partnership with an agile vendor."
