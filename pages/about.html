			<p>The Presidential Innovation Fellows (PIF) program was established by the White House in 2012 to attract top innovators into government, capable of tackling issues at the convergence of technology, policy, and process. Presidential Innovation Fellows serve for 12-months, during which they work on one or several initiatives, working to transform ideas into tangible results in at startup speed. Fellows operate with wide latitude for individual initiative in planning and executing solutions to problem, and spend a significant portion of their time co-working and collaborating with other Fellows. Throughout the program, Fellows receive support from partners and change agents in the White House across various federal agencies.</p>

The Presidential Innovation Fellows program functions as part of 18F Labs, an innovative group focused on incubating ideas, and accelearting them into game-changing initiatives across the federal government.</p>
