    quote: "First, what became apparent is that we did not understand the private sector well. For us to engage beyond transactional events, we need to know each other better. The second principle is finding mutual benefit. As the Presidential Innovation Fellows put it, ‘Measure value, not investigations.’... what is the value proposition for engagement with the private sector. Which then, now that you’ve identified how you work together, you move from information sharing to collaboration. And by collaboration it means, the third principle, you have to co-create the solution, which is a shift culturally. We like the control, we like to dictate what happens, but we’re looking at how do we do that with the private sector. How do we co-create their solution, and quite frankly it actually works better the iterations we've tried.",

In just six months, a team of Fellows developed and launched an end-to-end solution for creating digital records for historic files. Through crowdsourcing transcriptions, the project has engaged thousands of volunteers who have helped to transcribe and review historic and scientific records, making them easily accessible to the public for the first time.
