 To help entrepreneurs and business owners recover quickly from the pandemic, the Small Business Administration’s (SBA) Office of Entrepreneurial Development sought to get information and grants in the hands of those who needed it most. To accomplish this, the SBA needed to drive awareness of available aid, especially in traditionally underserved communities. 

Working with a data scientist from TTS’ Presidential Innovation Fellows (PIF) Program, SBA was able to identify the distribution of underserved entrepreneurial people participating in the Community Navigator Program and compare them with historical data to demonstrate the outcome and impact of this program. The Community Navigator Program provides services including financial assistance, access to capital, training and other resources to help stabilize or expand small businesses owned by veterans, women, and socially and economically disadvantaged individuals. Using data science and visual analytics techniques for quantitative and qualitative data across several sources of cross-agency data, the PIF developed a framework to analyze geographic and demographic data at a more granular level by incorporating additional datasets from other SBA programs and agency sources. This work also identified the frequently used languages used in small businesses served by this program and the need of multi-lingual service. The PIF partnered with other offices of SBA as well to map SBA eco-system and analyze and detect service opportunities in rural and urban areas.

This framework enabled SBA to set goals around equity, strategically partner with local organizations to conduct outreach in underserved communities, and improve access to the Community Navigator Program.
