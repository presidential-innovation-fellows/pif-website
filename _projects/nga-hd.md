NGA’s Human Development Directorate through strategic and collective partnerships, creates, leads and sustains a dynamic human capital system that is in alignment with the Agency’s culture and business strategy.  We design and implement policies and programs to attract, support, develop and retain a diverse and highly capable workforce.  We provide advice, consultation and a positive influence on the execution of human capital programs to leverage human talent and knowledge to its fullest potential.

As a Nation, we are facing significant changes in the domestic and global environment that stress the need to be ready to meet 21st century challenges and recognize emerging threats and opportunities. In order to navigate today’s turbulent and complex strategic environment, we are committed to doing things differently at NGA.

NGA’s 2025 Strategy has four goals:
<ul>
  <li>Inspire and Grow Our World-Class Workforce</li>
  <li>Fuel and Drive the Entire Global GEOINT Community</li>
  <li>Secure and Deliver the nation’s Most Trusted GEOINT</li>
  <li>Anticipate Opportunity and Foresee Threats</li>
  <li>In order to achieve these goals in a timely manner, NGA’s first imperative is to attract, develop, support and retain a diverse, highly skilled, agile and data-driven workforce.</li>
</ul>

NGA desires a Presidential Innovation Fellow to work with Agency senior leaders to perform an Agency culture analysis and develop the framework of a comprehensive culture plan founded on innovative data solutions. This Culture plan will align the Agency with its 2025 Strategy Goals, Workforce Imperatives and enable us to achieve our “moonshot” as described in the <a href="https://www.nga.mil">NGA Director’s Intent</a>.

Developing an executable NGA culture plan will greatly aid in operationalizing culture change management across the NGA enterprise.  Additionally, this culture plan will align and harmonize multiple business initiatives, and drive transformational change based on NGA’s Core Values of Excellence (Accountability, Respect, Teamwork and Honesty).

For this project, NGA is looking for a combination of the following skill sets:  Knowledge of cultural analysis/anthropology, understanding of change management principles, data analysis, visualization and communication,  project management, business development and human-centered design thinking
