title: "Accelerating technology research and implementation that lead to public safety and efficiency"
summary: "From developing the Department of Transportation's technology strategy and roadmap, to setting up centers of excellence in emerging technology areas, the PIF will be tasked with problem-solving America’s most pressing transportation matters."
project_challenge: "With myriad emerging technology poised to transform the way Americans move, how can we ensure America’s current and future transportation systems are safe and efficient?"
partner_description: "<p>The Department of Transportation’s Intelligent Transportation Systems Joint Program Office (ITS JPO) is the nexus of cutting-edge research, development and educational activities for technologies enabling society to move safer and more efficiently.</p>

<p>The ITS JPO is a research-focused technology development organization. We are a group of highly-motivated individuals from different walks of life working with and leading the department's cross-functional teams. While we think big, we start small then scale our successes. We operate as a meritocracy (your talent and work is your value, not your pedigree or rank), decisions are fueled by data, and we iterate and pivot based on what is of value to our stakeholders (Federal/State/Municipal/City agencies, the private sector, individual citizens, etc). As a senior advisor to the Joint Program Office, you will be integral to understanding and building solutions around key technologies including artificial intelligence (AI), automated driving and autonomous systems, wireless communications, cybersecurity and many more.</p>"

The Presidential Innovation Fellow is charged with bringing an innovator’s mindset to ITS JPO and accelerating research and implementation of technologies that lead to systemic public safety and efficiency. From developing the agency’s technology strategy and roadmap to setting up centers of excellence in emerging technology areas, the PIF will problem-solve America’s most pressing transportation matters.

The PIF will need to have significant experience with the full technology lifecycle (development, deployment, retirement/replacement). The PIF must be able to operate independently, as well as work in or lead teams to solve complex issues. The PIF must be proactive in understanding existing and potential problems while building relationships and leading change. Ability to communicate effectively at an executive level, both writing and presenting, is a must. In bringing on a seasoned technology professional, we hope to augment the core team’s deep understanding of transportation issues with data-driven solutions. Desired skills or expertise for Fellows include: AI/ML, cross-functional leadership, system dynamics, strategic thinking, innovation acceleration, model-based engineering, transportation systems experience, automation, wireless communications (5G), technology development and big data/data analysis.
