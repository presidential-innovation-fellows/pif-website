title: "Uniting communications and science to increase diverse representation in precision medicine research"
summary: "Presidential Innovation Fellows (PIF) leveraged their expertise across marketing and data to help launch unprecedented health research initiatives."
project_challenge: "How might we ensure that precision medicine serves diverse populations and researchers?"
partner_description: "<p>The <a href=\"https://www.joinallofus.org\"><em>All of Us</em> Research Program</a> at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) works to advance individualized health care by enrolling one million or more participants to contribute their health data over many years. <a href=\"https://allofus.nih.gov/about/diversity-and-inclusion\">The program aims to reflect the diversity of the United States</a> and to include participants from groups that have been <a href=\"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0234962\">underrepresented in health research in the past</a>, including ethnic, rural, low socio-economic and gender and sexual minorities. It has enrolled more than 270,000 people from across all 50 states -- 80% of whom come from communities historically underrepresented in research.</p>
<p>Enrolling and retaining participants is a challenge for many longitudinal studies, but <em>All of Us</em>’ commitment to previously underrepresented populations requires innovative approaches to build public trust in and researcher use of the program.</p>"

<p>Presidential Innovation Fellows <a href='https://presidentialinnovationfellows.gov/fellows/georgeta-dragoiu/'>Georgeta Dragoiu</a> and <a href='https://presidentialinnovationfellows.gov/fellows/adele-luta/'>Adele Luta</a> pooled their unique expertise as strategic communications and scientific leaders to support the <em>All of Us</em> Research Program in enrolling participants and activating a research community to help usher in a new era of precision medicine. Working hand-in-hand to meet these challenges, Georgeta launched communications campaigns to recruit a more diverse cohort of participants, and Adele focused on engaging an equally diverse community of researchers to use this rich national resource to drive health discoveries.</p>

<p>While Georgeta worked with the Chief Communications Officer to develop data-driven national and regional campaign strategies to enroll the public, Adele worked with the Chief Medical and Scientific Officer (CMSO) to create the tools necessary for researchers to study <em>All of Us</em>’ participant data. With so much rich and diverse data, <em>All of Us</em> has the power to look for answers to some of our hardest health questions. The resulting marketing strategy and researcher data platform together enable <em>All of Us</em> to gather, study and return health information creating value for participants, researchers, and the larger scientific community.</p>

## The impact
<p>Developing more precise communications has positioned <em>All of Us</em> to better reach, enroll and retain its participants. Georgeta helped develop a more participant-centered national communications strategy that crystallized the value of health research for participants and the potential for tailored care and treatments in the future. This participant-focused and data-driven communications strategy now underpins the development of the program’s national and local narrative development, earned, paid and social media.</p>

<p>But that’s only half the story. While Georgeta helped launch communications campaigns to enroll and retain participants, Adele helped simultaneously cultivate a rich and diverse research community by developing the <a href='https://allofus.nih.gov/news-events-and-media/announcements/all-us-research-program-begins-beta-testing-data-platform'><em>All of Us</em> Researcher Workbench</a>, a platform that offers researchers access to the rich data, workspaces, a Cohort Builder, and an interactive notebook environment. These tools are now available to registered and approved <em>All of Us</em> researcher accounts.</p>

<p>Engaging researchers to use this rich national resource to drive health discoveries is key, and the Workbench can inform thousands of research questions, covering a wide variety of health conditions. Registered and approved researchers have access to a rich data set drawing from electronic health records, biospecimens, surveys, and other measures creating a comprehensive set of biological, environmental, and behavioral data. The goal is for researchers from around the world to come together to answer questions around COVID-19, the value of diverse medical research is more important than ever.</p>

<p>In many ways, Georgeta and Adele’s complementary skill sets reflect the diverse and innovative nature of this ambitious program. From ideation and testimonial storytelling to accelerating medical breakthroughs through a collaborative and custom data platform, Presidential Innovation Fellows worked in partnership with <em>All of Us</em> leadership to showcase the program’s unique and tremendous impact.</p>
