The Department of Justice Civil Rights Division is looking for fellows who can translate user insights and organizational needs into visual and interactive elements, lead user testing efforts, content strategy, data visualization, and work with natural language data sources. Specific roles include:

<strong>UX Design:</strong> DOJ is looking for its first-ever UX designer to help grow UX/design capacity within the Civil Rights Division. The Fellow would bring design expertise and best practices to product teams tackling high impact technology projects that advance civil rights. Examples include:
<ul>
<li>Civil Rights Reporting Portal – a platform designed to transform how DOJ/CRT connects with victims of civil rights violations </li>
<li>ADA.gov - a high-value website that CRT will be re-developing to be a more effective digital catalyst for accessibility in the United States </li>
</ul>
The Fellow would also help the Civil Rights Division more broadly embed and incorporate human-centered design and a design mindset in its work.  They would do this by serving as an advisor to the Division's leadership, internal advocate, and teacher. In this role, they would uncover new opportunities where design could amplify civil rights-related efforts.

<strong>Content Strategy:</strong> DOJ's Civil Rights Division leads the federal government's efforts to enforce over thirty federal civil rights laws.  CRT has hundreds of legal professionals who specialize in civil rights. However, CRT has never had a specialist focused on translating this legal expertise into impactful, meaningful, and approachable information for various kinds of audiences. CRT is looking for a content strategist who can help us better make this connection. In the short term, the Fellow would focus on content strategy for CRT’s major engagement tools – the Civil Rights Division website, ADA.gov, and CRT’s internal knowledge-sharing platform. The Fellow may also work with subject matter specialists on more discreet/specific technical assistance materials. In the long term, the Fellow would help CRT establish new processes, standards, and capacities around content. CRT wants to create a foundation where the content we produce is consistently tailored to its intended audience and designed to maximize impact on civil rights.

<strong>Data Science:</strong> This summer, DOJ’s Civil Rights Division will be launching a new reporting portal. Using this system, CRT will process hundreds of thousands of reports of civil rights violations each year. CRT is looking for a data scientist who is able to take these reports and find ways to translate them into meaningful insights. This could include:
<ul>
<li>Quickly surfacing the most actionable violations</li>
<li>Finding trends and indicators to inform CRT’s broader enforcement strategy</li>
<li>Designing ways to enhance the review process for CRT staff</li>
</ul>
