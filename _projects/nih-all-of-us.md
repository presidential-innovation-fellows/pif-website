The All of Us Research Program at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) is building an engagement and digital data platform, enabling thousands of studies on what will be one of the world’s largest, most diverse biomedical data sets. All of Us will engage one million or more U.S. volunteers of all life stages, health statuses, races/ethnicities, geographic regions, etc., reflecting the rich diversity of America.

Mobilizing rich and constantly evolving data - from electronic health records, biospecimens, questionnaires, and electronic health records, to physical evaluations, sensors, and other technologies - the program will support research at the intersection of lifestyle, environment, and genetics to produce new knowledge, leading to the development of innovative prevention strategies and treatments for foundational health challenges.

The All of Us Research Program leadership is looking for additional outside capabilities to help with the following:

Engage participants: They will help us to make the participant experience delightful. Key experience would be user-centered design, product management, and launching large products. They may be more of a designer or more of a product manager, but, in either case, they help collect requirements, define solutions, rally support, and get something real out the door. And something we can show with pride.

Vet the research platform: They will help us understand if what we’re building will truly allow novel scientific discovery while remaining respectful of participants. They will have been a data scientist, and will help us find re-identification risk, prove out data integrity, test our data structures, and determine if we’ve got the right tools in place.

Win over researchers We made first contact with the research community, and now we need to develop that community, which includes not only using our data, but potentially investing in our platform. This person is an evangelist and must be a great speaker and listener. They’ll help us understand when we’re not connecting with researchers and why.

For these projects, the PIFs come into a consortium with dozens of companies and institutions, and the talent (and egos) to attempt something as audacious as All of Us. Thus, the individuals need to be entrepreneurial and have a high EQ and persuasive personality
