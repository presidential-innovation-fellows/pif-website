As part of this effort, the Department of VA/ORM is seeking Presidential Innovation Fellows to work on the following challenges:
<ul>
<li>Transition: Office of Resolution Management manages many challenges around the collection, management, and oversight of cases of discrimination for today's VA employees. How can we ensure from a Human-Centered Design and Customer Experience leadership perspective that the Department of VA/ORM is providing the right services and products to assist VA employees in understanding their rights, outreach efforts, and end-to-end management of those cases: what it looks like to the Department of VA/ORM employees and the journey of the VA employee?</li>
<li>APIs: As the second largest discrimination management program office in the Federal Government, VA has massive and valuable data. How can the Department of VA/ORM use data science to understand and predict based on insights they collect?</li>
</ul>
For these projects, the Department of VA/ORM is looking for the following skill sets: digital strategy, human-centered designer, enterprise design thinking, customer experience, data scientist with end-to-end (acquire, prepare, analyze, act) and change management expertise, product management, and management consulting.
