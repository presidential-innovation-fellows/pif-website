description: "<h5><b>CHALLENGE</b>: Make the Smithsonian Institute’s digitization of 137 million+ artifacts more findable, useful and informative to researchers and members of the public.</h5>

<h5><b>SOLUTION</b>: In just six months, a team of Fellows developed and launched an end-to-end solution for creating digital records for historic files. Through crowdsourcing transcriptions, the project has engaged thousands of volunteers who have helped to transcribe and review historic and scientific records, making them easily accessible to the public for the first time.</h5>"
