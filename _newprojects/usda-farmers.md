description: "<h5>To better serve America’s farmers, ranchers and foresters, the USDA’s Farm Production and Conservation (FPAC) mission area is building Farmers.gov, a dynamic online customer driven website that delivers the information, tools and advice. Farmers.gov will have an external website that will service as the customer gateway and a common customer portal where USDA customers can apply for programs, process technical and financial transactions and manage accounts. The portal will improve the delivery of information and programs to FPAC customers through a single digital experience leveraging an omni-channel approach that will increase efficiencies in support of the service centers and enable a consistent engagement (online and mobile) with self-service capabilities.</h5>
 
<h5>As part of this effort, USDA is looking for two Presidential Innovation Fellows (PIFs) with skills in digital strategy, user-centered design, product management, release management and solutions engineering and architecture to help lead the production of the Farmers.gov portal effort and function as a bridge between the IT and business stakeholders involved in the project.
