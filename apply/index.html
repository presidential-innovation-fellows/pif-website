                  <p><strong>Resume review</strong></p>
                  <p> The first hurdle of qualification is the GSA HR team conducting eligibility and resume review. Please review the specialized experience and IT competencies <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/apply/#:~:text=they%20are%20matched.-,Expertise,-To%20minimally%20qualify" data-proofer-ignore>listed above</a>. Candidates who make it past initial review will move on to the written assessment stage of qualification.</p>
                  
                  <p><strong>Written assessment</strong></p>
                  <p> All candidates who meet initial qualification will receive one week to complete a written assessment consisting of scored and unscored questions. Submissions will be reviewed and scored by subject matter experts.</p>
    
                  <p><strong>PIF interviews</strong></p>
                  <p>As the final hurdle in our <strong>qualification</strong> process, candidates who score highly on the written assessment will advance to PIF interviews which include questions regarding skills (your self-identified area of expertise), core competencies (behavioral questions, leadership, and/or navigating ambiguity), and core values (including diversity, equity, and inclusion). The PIF team will provide questions in advance of interviews to allow candidates time to prepare. </p>
                  <p>All interviews occur virtually and are typically scheduled for 1 hour. We offer live captioning and other accessibility assistance to all candidates upon request.</p>
                  <p><strong>Accessibility:</strong> If you are selected to interview, a member of our Talent Team will be in touch to ensure any accessibility considerations are covered. We typically conduct interviews as video calls, however, we realize that this option may not accommodate everyoneâ€™s needs. Throughout the hiring process, please donâ€™t hesitate to let us know if you have a preferred method of communication and we will work with you to create a positive experience. If you require accommodations, please contact us directly at pif-application@gsa.gov at least 24-48 hours in advance of your scheduled interview.</p>
                  <p>Once interviews are completed, our HR team will review all qualification scores and issue a certificate of qualified candidates who can be <strong>considered</strong> for agency projects.</p>
