                  <p><strong>Resume review</strong></p>
                  <p> The first hurdle of qualification is the GSA HR team conducting eligibility and resume review. Please review the specialized experience and IT competencies <a href="https://www.usajobs.gov/job/808657100">listed on the now-closed job posting</a>. Candidates who make it past initial review will move on to the written assessment stage of qualification.</p>
                  
                  <p><strong>Written assessment</strong></p>
                  <p> All candidates who meet initial qualification will receive one week to complete a written assessment consisting of scored and unscored questions. Submissions will be reviewed and scored by subject matter experts.</p>
    
                  <p><strong>PIF interviews</strong></p>
                  <p>As the final hurdle in our <strong>qualification</strong> process, candidates who score highly on the written assessment will advance to PIF interviews which include questions regarding skills (your self-identified area of expertise), core competencies (behavioral questions, leadership, and/or navigating ambiguity), and core values. The PIF team will provide questions in advance of interviews to allow candidates time to prepare. </p>
                  <p>All interviews occur virtually and are typically scheduled for 1 hour. We offer live captioning and other accessibility assistance to all candidates upon request.</p>

                <p>As the final hurdle in our <strong>qualification</strong> process, candidates who score highly on the written assessment will advance to PIF interviews which include questions regarding skills (your self-identified area of expertise), core competencies (behavioral questions, leadership, and/or navigating ambiguity), and core values.
