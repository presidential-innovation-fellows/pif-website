        <h2><span>PIF Application Overview</span></h2>
      </div>
      <div class="desktop:grid-col-8">
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Who may apply:</strong> All United States citizens and nationals (residents of American Samoa and Swains Island) are eligible to apply.</li>
          <li><strong>Applications due:</strong> Friday July 8, 11:59 PM PST</li>
          <li><strong>How to apply:</strong> Complete <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfvcTc_cxzY3J8tcbkqXiXNogE6JJqbIh9esVuCOofolmKE9w/viewform" target="_blank"> our application form</a>, following all instructions.</li>
          <li><strong>Benefits:</strong> All PIFs receive <a href="https://handbook.tts.gsa.gov/benefits/" target="_blank"> federal employee benefits.</a> This includes medical, vision, and dental insurance, FSA accounts, life insurance, paid leave, and the Thrift Savings Plan (the government version of a 401K) with up to five percent matching.</li>
          <li><strong>Location:</strong> <strong>Washington, D.C.</strong> Presidential Innovation Fellows are based in Washington, D.C., for the duration of the fellowship. Fellows will spend a portion of their time working at one of the federal agencies to which they are assigned, which are often in Washington, D.C. or the surrounding area. Fellows occasionally co-work and collaborate on projects in space provided by the General Services Administration. In addition to onsite work at agencies, we believe that sharing a D.C. “home base” helps foster community.</li>
          <li><strong>Salary:</strong> All Presidential Innovation Fellows are hired at the GS-15 Step 1 pay grade (the GS system defines many federal salaries - learn more about what this means <a href="https://join.tts.gsa.gov/compensation-and-benefits/" target="_blank"> here</a>). As of May 2022, the GS-15 Step 1 salary for the Washington, D.C. locality is $148,484.22.</li>
          <li><strong>Start Date:</strong> PIF’s next cohort will have an April 2023 start date. We will be announcing the exact date as we get farther along in the process.</li>
          <li><strong>Education requirements:</strong> No, PIF does not have education requirements.</li>

      <div class="desktop:grid-col-8">
        <p class="font-body-lg">For candidates selected to interview, here’s our process:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Accessibility:</strong> If you are selected to interview, a member of our Talent Team will be in touch to ensure any accessibility considerations are covered. We typically conduct interviews as video calls, however, we realize that this option may not accommodate everyone’s needs. Throughout the hiring process, please don’t hesitate to let us know if you have a preferred method of communication and we will work with you to create a positive experience. If you require accommodations, please contact us directly at <a href="mailto:pif-application@gsa.gov" target="_blank">pif-application@gsa.gov</a> at least 24-48 hours in advance of your scheduled interview.</li>
          <li><strong>PIF interviews</strong> begin with skills (your self-identified area of expertise), and candidates may progress to core competencies (behavioral questions, leadership, and/or navigating ambiguity) and core values (including diversity, equity, and inclusion). The PIF team will provide questions in advance of each interview to allow candidates time to prepare.</li>
          <li><strong>Agency interviews</strong> are with PIF’s federal agency partner(s). This is a conversation with the agency’s PIF project champion. The PIF team will share finalist resumes with agencies who then identify candidates that they would like to interview.</li>
          <li><strong>Format:</strong> All interviews occur virtually and are typically scheduled for 1-2 hours in length. We offer live captioning and other accessibility assistance to all candidates.</li>
          <li><strong>Offer Process:</strong> Once the agency interviews are complete, the PIF team will meet with each agency to discuss their selections. This gives us our list of finalists to whom we make offers! We operate within the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA), and the GSA HR team will then make tentative offers to selected candidates. The PIF team will also set up calls with each incoming PIF to welcome them into our program and community, and answer any questions!</li>
          <li><strong>Onboarding:</strong> PIF augments GSA onboarding with a week of PIF-specific programming, followed by each PIF onboarding at their respective agencies.</li>
