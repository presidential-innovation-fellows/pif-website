## Qualifications

In order to properly be able to evaluate your previous experience, we recommend being as detailed as possible in your resume and following our general guidance on creating federal style resume.

To qualify for this role, you must have one year of specialized experience. Specialized experience is:

- Experience leading vision, direction, roadmap or leading the identification of user needs for a project, product, platform, or service.
- Experience providing project or product leadership.
- Experience with iterative or agile methodologies.
- Experience leading cross-functional teams.
- Experience collaborating with senior or executive stakeholders.
- Experience collaborating with cross-functional teams to achieve organizational or project objectives.
- Experience leading stakeholders through organizational change.

Qualification determinations cannot be made when resumes do not include the required information, so failure to provide this information may result in disqualification.

**For each job on your resume, provide:**

- the exact dates you held each job (from month/year to month/year or “present”).
- number of hours per week you worked (if part time).

## Evaluation

The information in this section outlines the criteria that your application will be evaluated against to determine if you meet the Qualifications for the position. There are two very important things to note about this step in the process:

1. Only applications found “minimally qualified” can be considered for interviews.
2. The Minimum Qualification determination can only be made using the information that’s directly within your resume and directly associated your listed work experience. Examples of stuff that can’t be used for minimum qualification:
* Links to portfolios or other external materials (Yes, the links themselves may be “directly” on the resume but the information is not).
* Information you include in cover letters, responses to questions, etc. as these are not directly associated with your work experience.
* Lists of tools, technologies, programming languages, etc. that are listed separately from your work experience.

It is important to note that we do take everything listed above into consideration when deciding who we select to interview. The **Qualification** process is a bureaucratic requirement that we are stuck with. It’s best to think about it as the most intense and rigorous resume review you’ve ever heard of. To get through this process, you need make sure your resume directly reflects the **Qualification** section.
