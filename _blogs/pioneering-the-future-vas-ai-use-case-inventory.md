# Pioneering the Future: VA’s AI Use Case Inventory

Innovation is at the heart of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), and our 2024 AI Use Case Inventory reflects that spirit. This collection of over 200 artificial intelligence (AI) initiatives showcases how we’re embracing cutting-edge technology to improve the lives of Veterans and empower VA staff. From advancing health care diagnostics with computer vision to streamlining benefits claims with generative AI, this catalog is a testament to the power of ingenuity and collaboration across the VA. 

But this inventory isn’t just a list of projects; it’s a blueprint for the future. The journey to create this comprehensive resource taught us valuable lessons, highlighted the power of preparation, and underscored the importance of fostering a culture of innovation. 

## A Launchpad for Innovation 
When the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) issued Memorandum M-24-10 (PDF, 34 pages, 518KB) in March 2024, federal agencies were tasked with creating detailed AI use case inventories. For VA, this wasn’t only a requirement — it was an opportunity to lead. By building processes to ensure transparency and accountability, we created an inventory that goes beyond compliance, serving as a cornerstone for responsible AI deployment. 


## How We Built a Culture of Collaboration and Growth 

### Starting Ahead of the Game

Before OMB’s guidance became official, we hit the ground running by: 

- **Defining leadership roles** within the VA Office of the Chief AI Officer. 
- **Creating early intake tools** to gather initial use case data effortlessly. 
- **Streamlining decision-making** for project teams with clear reporting guidelines. 
- **Implementing automated data pipelines** to efficiently manage incoming information. 

This forward-thinking approach saved time and allowed us to innovate while meeting requirements. 

### Harnessing the Power of Technology 

Our nimble team turned complexity into simplicity by designing automated systems that: 

- **Integrate governance seamlessly** across the VA’s divisions. 
- **Improve data quality and reporting** with smart digital forms. 
- **Centralize resources**, ensuring clarity and alignment for all stakeholders. 

### Building Bridges Through Communication

To support teams across VA, we built robust communication networks, including: 

- A **dedicated support email** for inventory inquiries. 
- A **comprehensive resource website** to share guidance and updates. 
- Regular **office hours** to answer questions in real time. 

These efforts ensure that help is always available when needed. 

Tackling Challenges with Optimism
While tight timelines and evolving requirements posed challenges, we embraced them as opportunities to refine our systems. By prioritizing high-impact cases, collaborating with external stakeholders like the FDA, and leveraging existing evaluations, we ensured our approach was thorough and efficient. 

What We Learned
Our experience reinforced the importance of starting early, focusing on high-impact areas, and staying adaptable. These lessons are valuable not only for VA but for any organization aiming to build a strong foundation for AI governance. 

To our peers in the federal AI governance community, our experience offers these lessons: 

- **Start small** and scale as you go. 
- **Collaborate across teams and agencies** to share resources and expertise. 
- **Document decisions rigorously**, creating a transparent framework for the future. 

For policymakers, we advocate for more predictable timelines, earlier guidance, and open-source tools to support agencies with varying technical resources. 

## The Path Forward
Our experience with M-24-10 compliance has shown that successful AI governance requires a combination of proactive planning, technical capability, and clear communication channels. While we faced significant challenges with timelines and guidance interpretation, our approach created a foundation that will serve both the VA and the Veterans we support well into the future.  

For all agencies beginning this journey, the goal isn’t simply compliance — it’s about building trust through transparency and ensuring AI systems serve the public interest effectively and ethically. Despite tight deadlines associated with a process new to many federal agencies, which adds friction to meeting reporting requirements, VA found strong partners in OMB and other policy stakeholders. By focusing first on principles around documentation, as a form of accountability, and transparency for individual use cases, any agency can achieve proper risk management.  

The inventory we’ve created is just the beginning. As AI technology evolves, so too will our approach to governance. We’re committed to sharing our experiences and learning from others as we work together to ensure responsible AI use across government.  

## A Future Full of Possibilities 
Our 2024 AI Use Case Inventory is more than a compliance document — it’s a celebration of what’s possible when innovation meets purpose. From enhancing healthcare by streamlining administrative tasks or improving cancer detection, to safeguarding benefit delivery from fraud, our AI initiatives are making a tangible difference in the lives of Veterans. We’re proud to lead by example, and we’re committed to sharing our journey as we continue to evolve.
