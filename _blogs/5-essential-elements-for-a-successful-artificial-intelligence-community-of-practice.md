## An insight into the federal AI Community of Practice (AI CoP), which was established to foster responsible AI adoption across US government.

- **The opportunity:** There is currently an opportunity for the US government to champion responsible AI education, innovation and integration across federal agencies.
- **Why it matters:** Artificial intelligence adoption is rapidly becoming crucial for government agencies to improve service delivery and achieve their missions.
- **The solution:** By focusing on community engagement, public-private partnerships, delivering tangible value and nurturing future emerging technology leaders, the AI CoP has become instrumental in advancing responsible AI adoption and innovation within the US government.

In today's rapidly evolving technological landscape, the integration of [artificial intelligence](https://apolitical.co/solution-articles/en/how-to-not-get-overwhelmed-by-ai-trends) (AI) into governmental operations and services has shifted from being a mere possibility to an imperative. Spearheading this transformation in the US is the Artificial Intelligence Community of Practice (AI CoP), a pivotal initiative launched in 2019 by the General Services Administration’s (GSA) Office of Technology Transformation Services (TTS) in coordination with the Office of the Federal Chief Information Officer at the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). The AI CoP was originally created to promote cooperation among federal agencies in adopting AI technologies. Over time, its role has expanded to become a fundamental aspect of ensuring that AI is implemented in a responsible and effective manner throughout the US federal government.

### What is a Community of Practice (CoP)?
The AI CoP defines communities of practice as “interest groups that provide opportunities for members to support, challenge and inspire one another”. The three distinct elements that comprise a CoP are:

1. Interaction: Discussions, collaborative activities and relationship building
2. Shared domain of interest: Common goals, topics or areas of focus shared by multiple groups; ranging from broad subjects, such as artificial intelligence or customer experience to narrow ones like federal technology acquisition and municipal call centre management
3. Shared practice: Shared techniques, skills and expertise including material creation and distribution

This approach enables professionals to grow and mature while focusing on efforts to share knowledge and solve problems.

### Why would an AI CoP matter?
An AI Community of Practice can:

- Solve shared problems with inter-agency/inter-division working groups
- Promote the spread of best practices
- Develop professional skills
- Help recruit and retain talent
- Enable connections across hierarchies and silos (i.e., government bureaucracy)

### Evolution and purpose
The US Government’s inter-agency Artificial Intelligence Community of Practice (AI CoP) began its journey in 2019 with a mandate to facilitate dialogue and cooperation among federal entities exploring AI adoption. When directives such as the [2020 Executive Order on Promoting Trustworthy AI (EO 13960)](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2020/12/08/2020-27065/promoting-the-use-of-trustworthy-artificial-intelligence-in-the-federal-government) and the [AI Training Act of 2022 (Public Law 117-207)](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/senate-bill/2551) reshaped their operating landscape, the AI CoP adapted its programming to align with these policies by revamping challenge competitions, reformatting member-wide communications and more. Today, its mission extends beyond technology adoption to include comprehensive workforce development and AI literacy education across 80+ member agencies.



### The five pillars of success
The success of the AI CoP is underpinned by five foundational principles, each critical to its operational framework and impact:

**1. Executive leadership buy-in**

From its inception, the AI CoP executive director prioritised securing support from top-level leadership early and often. By engaging with key stakeholders across the White House, GSA and other federal agencies the AI CoP laid a solid foundation for continuous improvement. This proactive approach ensured alignment with emerging legislative priorities, stimulated a collaborative space conducive to accountability and paved a clear path for challenging conversations as they arose.

**2. Community engagement and culture building**

Beyond co-developing and propagating policy frameworks, the AI CoP recognises the importance of cultivating a vibrant culture. Encouraging active participation through 40+ community-ideated events, expert workshops and peer-to-peer knowledge-sharing sessions, the AI CoP’s steering committee members and working group leads nurture a community where problems are solved and challenges are met with collective expertise. This approach enhances AI literacy and inspires creative solutions to complex challenges.

**3. Public-private partnerships**

Recognising the transformative potential of public-private partnerships, the AI CoP continually forges and strengthens alliances with academic institutions specialising in human-centred AI, information technology policy and law. Collaborating with leading universities, industry experts and non-profit organisations enriches its knowledge base and facilitates the development of cutting-edge AI applications tailored to meet governmental needs. These partnerships exemplify the AI CoP's commitment to leveraging external expertise for the benefit of public service.

**4. Delivering tangible value**

Central to its mission, the AI CoP focuses on delivering tangible value through practical initiatives and outcomes. The AI CoP hosts specialised training programmes led by award-winning experts, helping federal employees understand the computer science, economics, law, political science and psychological implications of AI through case studies and live Q&A discussions. Additionally, the AI CoP organises ‘Applied AI Challenges’. These competitions seek diverse and practical solutions to help federal agencies quickly identify, demonstrate, test and acquire promising new AI technology. By cultivating a safe environment where government officials can share their challenges and receive feedback from knowledgeable peers from different agencies, the AI CoP empowers change-makers and innovators in government to bring creative solutions to benefit their agencies and the American people.

**5. Building leadership and talent pipeline**

The AI CoP places significant emphasis on developing top talent to create a pipeline for future CoP and AI initiative leaders, fostering an inclusive environment where diversity is valued and leveraged to achieve its mission. Members are empowered to lead discussions on topics like natural language processing, computer vision, reinforcement learning, AI security and generative AI within their management chains. Expert guidance, including from [Presidential Innovation Fellows](https://presidentialinnovationfellows.gov/), supports this upskilling effort through human-centred programme design and strategy. Additionally, the CoP conducted a survey of AI practitioners in the federal workforce, informing policies such as the AI Executive Order and AI Talent Surge. By prioritising people and their experiences, the AI CoP aims to drive transformative change beyond just adopting AI tools.

**Conclusion**

In conclusion, the journey of the Artificial Intelligence Community of Practice (AI CoP) exemplifies a proactive approach to US government [innovation](https://apolitical.co/solution-articles/en/what-is-government-innovation). Guided by collaboration, innovation and inclusivity, the AI CoP shines as a beacon of excellence in advancing effective governance through technological innovation. Looking ahead, the AI CoP's legacy highlights the power of collaboration in uniting the best people, processes and products for the public good.
