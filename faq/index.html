            <p>Fun, we hope! For candidates selected to interview, here’s our process.<p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>First round interviews</strong> include skills (your area of expertise), core competencies (behavioral questions, leadership, and navigating ambiguity), and core values (including diversity, equity, and inclusion).</li>
              <li><strong>Second round (and final) interviews</strong> are with PIF’s federal agency partner(s). This is a conversation with the agency’s PIF project champion. The PIF team will share finalist resumes with agencies who then identify candidates that they would like to interview.</li>
              <li><strong>Format:</strong> All interviews occur virtually and are typically scheduled for 1-2 hours in length. We offer live captioning or other accessibility assistance to all candidates. If you are selected to interview, a member of our Talent Team will be in touch to ensure we’ll have any accessibility considerations covered.</li>
              <li><strong>Offer Process:</strong> Once the agency interviews are complete, the PIF team will meet with each agency to discuss their selections. This gives us our list of finalists to whom we make offers! We operate within the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA), and the GSA HR team will then make tentative offers to selected candidates. The PIF team will also set up calls with each incoming PIF to welcome them into our program and community, and answer any questions!</li>

            <p>All government positions require some level of background check. Most roles at PIF require a public trust position clearance, which is more thorough than most private-sector background checks but not as intensive as a higher government security clearance. The clearance process adds some time and forms to the hiring process, but the GSA Human Resources team will guide you through it. GSA is the federal agency under which PIF operates.</p>

We’re proud to lead cross-agency innovation that leads to better government by and for the people. Our work aligns to Administration priorities, the President’s Management Agenda (i.e. improving customer experience), and we have led or contributed to White House innovation efforts (i.e. promoting the trustworthy use of AI, or serving as first responders to healthcare.gov).</p>

            <p> Established in 2012, the Presidential Innovation Fellows (PIF) program is a fellowship that recruits senior-level private sector leaders with a proven track record in design, technology, entrepreneurship, and strategy. PIF exists to unite innovators with federal leaders across government to solve our nation’s toughest challenges and emerging issues. 

              The Presidential Management Fellows (PMF) program is administered by the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM). Since 1977, the PMF program has been a part of the Pathways Programs and matches current graduate students or recent graduate students with federal agencies within the Executive Branch. PMF exists to recruit and develop a core of future government leaders from all segments of society. To learn more about the PMF program, please visit their website at <a href="https://www.pmf.gov/">PMF.gov.</a></p>
