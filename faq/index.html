            <p>Fun, we hope! For candidates selected to interview, here’s our process.<p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>First round interviews</strong> include skills (your area of expertise), core competencies (behavioral questions, leadership, and navigating ambiguity), and core values (including diversity, equity, and inclusion).</li>
              <li><strong>Second round (and final) interviews</strong> are with PIF’s federal agency partner(s). This is a conversation with the agency’s PIF project champion. The PIF team will share finalist resumes with agencies who then identify candidates that they would like to interview.</li>
              <li><strong>Format:</strong> All interviews occur virtually and are typically scheduled for an hour in length. We offer live captioning or other accessibility assistance to all candidates. If you are selected to interview, a member of our Talent Team will be in touch to ensure we’ll have any accessibility considerations covered.</li>
              <li><strong>Offer Process:</strong> Once the agency interviews are complete, the PIF team will meet with each agency to discuss their selections. This gives us our list of finalists to whom we make offers! We operate within the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA), and the GSA HR team will then make tentative offers to selected candidates. The PIF team will also set up calls with each incoming PIF to welcome them into our program and community, and answer any questions!</li>

            <p>All government positions require some level of background check. Most roles at PIF require a public trust position clearance, which is more thorough than most private-sector background checks but not as intensive as a higher government security clearance. The clearance process adds some time and forms to the hiring process, but the GSA Human Resources team will guide you through it. GSA is the federal agency under which PIF operates.</p>

            <p>Presidential Innovation Fellows have the history, opportunity, and responsibility to rally and ship human-centered solutions to our nation’s greatest challenges. Our program structure, timeline, and projects are continuing stronger than ever. We have a robust portfolio of projects and, on October 19, 2020, <a href="https://www.gsa.gov/blog/2020/10/19/passion-and-purpose-meet-the-2021-presidential-innovation-fellows">we announced 34 new Presidential Innovation Fellows</a> who will be working alongside 22 federal agency projects to build innovative solutions to issues of national importance, including COVID-19 response. We’re actively monitoring and prioritizing health and safety. Now, as always, Presidential Innovation Fellows are needed to modernize and build resilience in our government, and we are grateful for our fellows’ service - as well as that of every public servant.</p>

            <p>No. While <a href="https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2012/08/23/white-house-launches-presidential-innovation-fellows-program">PIF was founded by the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) in 2012</a>, we have been administered within the General Services Administration (GSA) since 2013. We’re proud to lead cross-agency innovation that leads to better government by and for the people. Our work may align to the President’s Management Agenda (i.e. improving customer experience), and we have led or contributed to White House innovation efforts (i.e. promoting the trustworthy use of AI, or serving as first responders to healthcare.gov), but we are a non-partisan, apolitical, administration-agnostic organization! We’re here for the people.</p>

            <p>No, but there are some great organizations where college students and recent graduates can get involved in civic tech. We recommend checking out Coding It Forward, Code for America, and United States of Technologists (USofTech), or researching “civic tech” or “public interest tech” in your area.</p>

            <p>The number of fellows throughout the year varies, depending on the needs of our partner agencies and projects we are supporting. We currently have nearly 60 fellows in the program, 34 of whom are in our newest 2021 cohort, and 20+ of whom are returning fellows. We typically recruit 20-30 fellows for each new cohort.</p>

            <p>More than 50% of fellows take government leadership roles after PIF. For example, one PIF became the U.S. Deputy Chief Technology Officer under the Obama administration! Many others take exciting private-sector roles and even start their own companies. We have an active alumni foundation that hosts networking and community events.</p>
